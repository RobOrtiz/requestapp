# NOI: Request Application

## About 

This app provides a service for DJ's to receive requests from fans (customers) live at their events. NOI mobile application organizes requests into two categories: "General Requests" and "Play Now" requests. Once a DJ accepts the request it is moved into the "Queue" with the highest tip amount shown first. THe DJ plays the request and they select the "Played" option in the queue and the customer is notified that their song is playing.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:
